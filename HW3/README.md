 # Homework 3

Assignment 1

I generate 100 random samples with varied size (from 20 to 2000) for 6 different distributions which are gaussian,poisson,chisquare,exponential,gamma and binomial.

For each distribution, I plot its 100 samples' size against its mean. 

Finally, I plot a histogram of the means of all the samples.

Assignment 2

I use both binomial and chisquare distribution to reproduce the post-prison employment research.
