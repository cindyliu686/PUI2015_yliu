NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
==================

the colors are not explained nor is the transparency

for the large numbers on x and y axis a more concise notation should be chosen

the 3d dimension is unnecessary and possibly redundant with the color. 

the 3d dimension makes the readability of the Square footage and of the # of units hard to read away from the edges of the respective axis ranges



NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===========================================


yx1125
======






Colors are indistinguishable for color blind people

tick labels are too small


it would be nice if it said "basketball" somewhere, and had the date of the data

the points are too small resulting in a lot of empathy space (remember tufte's rules) and the points at 0 are chopped by the axis: an offset should be provided

otherwise clear and not misleading


yx1088
======


the color is not explained

units re missing on the x and y labels (seconds?)

the units on the tick labels should be compressed 

the plot is very informative (one of the best seaborn visualizations) but poorly documented 





jz2308
======

too m any categories: the difference in size cannot be told apart

x, y labels and ticks and title  too small

circles size and transparency used to convey the same information: this just makes things confusing.
